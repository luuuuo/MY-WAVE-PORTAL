### hardhat hre

> The Hardhat Runtime Environment, or HRE for short, is an object containing all the functionality that Hardhat exposes when running a task, test or script. In reality, Hardhat is the HRE.

So what does this mean? Well, every time you run a terminal command that starts with `npx hardhat` you are getting this `hre` object built on the fly using the `hardhat.config.js` specified in your code! This means you will never have to actually do some sort of import into your files like:

`const hre = require("hardhat")`

**TL;DR - you will be seeing `hre` a lot in our code, but never imported anywhere! Checkout this cool [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/advanced/hardhat-runtime-environment.html?utm_source=buildspace.so&utm_medium=buildspace_project) to learn more about it!**

### dotenv

**If uploading to Github or using git version control in general it is good practice to protect yourself from uploading secrect keys to somewhere you don't want them. First of all the best way is to not upload your hardhat config file by adding it to .gitignore.**

Another way of protecting yourself and keeping `hardhat.config.js` secure is to use dotenv

### window.ethereum()

If we have Metamask browser extension wallet installed, it will automatically inject a special object named `ethereum` into our window. Let's check if we have that first.

connect wallet

```javascript
const getEthereumObject = () => window.ethereum;
const ethereum = getEthereumObject();
const accounts = await ethereum.request({
  method: "eth_requestAccounts",
});
```


### React useState()


### Solidity

difference between memory type and storage ?

fund the contract

```solidity
constructor() payable {}
```

when deploy

```javascript
const constwaveContract = awaitwaveContractFactory.deploy({value:hre.ethers.utils.parseEther("0.001"),});
```

avoid annoying

- random number
- cooldown mechanism
